Sure, I'll try to explain how the code works. The code is divided into four parts:

- The first part defines the constants and the initial parameters of the turbine, such as the initial air pressure and temperature, the ratio of specific heats for air, the mechanical and isentropic efficiencies of the turbine and compressor, the number of stages, and the diameters and angles of the rotors and nozzles.
- The second part defines the objective function to minimize, which is the negative of the efficiency of the turbine. The efficiency is calculated using the energy balance and thermodynamic relations for each stage of the turbine. The objective function takes a vector of variables as input and returns a scalar value as output.
- The third part defines the bounds and constraints for the variables, such as the minimum and maximum values for the diameters and angles. The bounds are given as a list of tuples, and the constraints are given as a list of dictionaries.
- The fourth part imports the optimization module from scipy library and uses the differential evolution algorithm to find the optimal solution. The algorithm iteratively modifies a population of candidate solutions until it converges to a global minimum. The result is printed as the optimal values for the variables and the corresponding peak efficiency.

I hope this helps you understand how the code works.ðŸ˜Š
